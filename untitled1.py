# 2. Write code that uses the string stored in org and creates an acronym which is assigned to the variable acro.
# Only the first letter of each word should be used, each letter in the acronym should be a capital letter, and there should be nothing to separate the letters of the acronym.
# Words that should not be included in the acronym are stored in the list stopwords. 
# For example, if org was assigned the string “hello to world” then the resulting acronym should be “HW”.
